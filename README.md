# SpaceShooter
A simple endless bullet-hell game


Its a kinda rework of my first game but on Unity engine. There a lot of improvements since my first project on AppGameKit.
In this project you can use scriptable objects like "waypoints of enemies" and "paths".

!!!Optimized for 9:16 resolution!!!

This Space Shooter have a:

— menu with UI 
— a mechanics to pause game
— some simpliest VFX created via particles
— endless waves of enemies
— powerups (shield and "kill all enemies on screen")
— non-static background with moving stars (with kinda parallax effects)
— different enemies.
